# Total RP 3: KuiNameplates, version 1.3.0

Fixed a lot of issues. I basically rewrote this module entirely to be more robust and behave better with KuiNameplates.

- The issue where guild names would disappear has been fixed in the process (note that if you have the player title option enable it replaces guild text).
- Long titles are now limited to 40 characters.

This version requires version 1.2.9 for Total RP 3.
