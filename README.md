This [Total RP 3] module adds several customizations to [KuiNameplates] (**both [Total RP 3] and [KuiNameplates] add-ons are of course required**):

* See the **full RP name of a character on their nameplate**, instead of their default name, colored like in their tooltip.
* **Hide the names of players without an RP profile!** (*Off by default, can be enabled in the settings*)
* See **customized pets names** (only for pets with a nameplate, if enabled, like hunters or warlocks).
* See their **custom title** if they have one. (*Off by default, can be enabled in the settings*)

You can fine tune the settings of this module in the settings of Total RP 3 to have it only customize the nameplates when you are "In Character" or disable individual customizations.
